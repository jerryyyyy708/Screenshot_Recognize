# Screenshot_Recognize
## Dataset Information & datasource
This dataset consists of 964 photos, with 500 photos from screenshots (including screenshots from games, animate, message applicationâ€¦etc), and 464 photos from camera. 

To make it easier to be used in model, the photos are resized into 64x64. 
(for your own picture, you can use img_resizer.py to transform it)

The mission is to classify whether the given picture is screenshot or from camera.

## Algorithm
**Logistic Regression:** 
Raising the epoch round appropriately can rise the accuracy. If lower epoch rounds are used, we can raise the learning rate to get a better performance

**CNN:**
It already has a great performance with 5 epochs. Using 20 epochs can raise its accuracy to 98.6%, with 100% accuracy predicting camera photos!

## Result
Using KFold cross validation (mean of four folds)
Train size:723  Test size:240  LR: Logistic Regression a: Learning Rate
